# What's for Dinner?

**Abstract:** This app is designed to help users decide what to cook for dinner by providing random dish suggestions for different categories. Users can choose from sides, mains, and desserts, and with a simple click of the button, they receive a random dish idea to inspire their meal planning. Additionally, users have the option to select an entire meal, which provides a complete dinner suggestion consisting of a side, main, and dessert.

**Learning Goals:**
- Gain experience building an application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp.
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events.
- Develop individualized programming skills and problem-solving abilities.

**Expectations:**
To gauge your progress during this project, the expectation is to complete the MVP (iteration 1) and at least one "Choose Your Own Adventure" (CYOA) feature. If you feel up to the challenge, you can choose to implement more CYOA features.

**Setup:**
1. Fork this project to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Read this README thoroughly, then begin working!

**Workflow:**
Ensure you follow Git best practices by using branches and committing frequently.

**Day One Deliverables:**
By the end of the kickoff day:

- Carefully review the project specification.

**Iteration 0: Build Out Comp**
- An assets directory is provided in the repo, and colors are specified in the CSS file.
- Don't concern yourself with the "Add a Recipe" button and "Entire Meal" radio button for now.

**Iteration 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Add Random Side, Main, and Dessert Functionality**
- When a user selects a dish option (excluding "Entire Meal") and clicks the "Let's Cook!" button, they should see a random dish from the list of possible dishes for that category.
- When the dish name appears, the cookpot icon should disappear.

**Choose Your Own Adventure:**
In the spirit of personalizing your project and building your skills, you have the option to choose additional features to add. You can select one or more of the following features, but ensure you complete all bullet points for the chosen features.

**Entire Meal Functionality:**
- When the user selects the "Entire Meal" option and clicks the "Let's Cook!" button, they should see a message with a side, main, and dessert option from the lists of possible dishes for all categories.
- When the meal items appear, the cookpot icon should disappear.

**Wins:**
- Successful implementation of the core functionality, providing random dish suggestions.
- Creation of a visually appealing user interface (UI).
- Effective collaboration with a focus on individual strengths.
- Enhanced understanding of JavaScript and user interaction.

**Challenges:**
- Debugging and ensuring the MVP is fully functional and free of bugs.
- Balancing individualized feature implementation with project completion.
- Ensuring the UI is responsive and works across different browsers.
